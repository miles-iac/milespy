  abstract = {A new stellar library at the near-IR spectral region developed for the empirical calibration of the Caii triplet and stellar population synthesis modelling is presented. The library covers the range {$\lambda\lambda$}8348-9020 at 1.5-{\AA} (FWHM) spectral resolution, and consists of 706 stars spanning a wide range in atmospheric parameters. We have defined a new set of near-IR indices, CaT*, CaT and PaT, which mostly overcome the limitations of previous definitions, the former being specially suited for the measurement of the Caii triplet strength corrected for the contamination from Paschen lines. We also present a comparative study of the new and the previous Ca indices, as well as the corresponding transformations between the different systems. A thorough analysis of the sources of index errors and the procedure to calculate them is given. Finally, index and error measurements for the whole stellar library are provided together with the final spectra.},

  abstract = {Aims: We present a number of improvements to the MILES library and stellar population models. We correct some small errors in the radial velocities of the stars, measure the spectral resolution of the library and models more accurately, and give a better absolute flux calibration of the models. Methods: We use cross-correlation techniques to correct the radial velocities of the offset stars and the penalised pixel-fitting method, together with different sets of stellar templates, to re-assess the spectral resolution of the MILES stellar library and models. We have also re-calibrated the zero-point flux level of the models using a new calibration scheme. Results: The end result is an even more homogeneously calibrated stellar library than the originally released one, with a measured spectral resolution of {\textasciitilde}2.5 {\AA}, almost constant with wavelength, for both the MILES stellar library and models. Furthermore, the new absolute flux calibration for the spectra excellently agrees with predictions based on independent photometric libraries. Conclusions: This improved version of the MILES library and models (version 9.1) is available at the project's website (http://miles.iac.es).},

A new, high-resolution library of theoretical stellar spectra is generated that is specifically designed for use in stellar population studies.

We also test the models against the MILES and MaStar libraries of empirical stellar spectra and also find reasonable agreements, as expected from previous work. We then use the abundance pattern predictions of the new theoretical stellar spectra to differentially correct MILES spectra to create semi-empirical MILES (sMILES) star spectra with abundance patterns that differ from those present in the Milky Way. The final result is five families of 801 sMILES stars with [{$\alpha$}/Fe] abundances ranging from -0.20 to 0.60 dex at MILES resolution (FWHM = 2.5 {\AA}) and wavelength coverage (3540.5--7409.6 {\AA}).

  abstract = {Context. The spectral predictions of stellar population models are not as accurate in the ultra-violet (UV) as in the optical wavelength domain. One of the reasons is the lack of high-quality stellar libraries. The New Generation Stellar Library (NGSL), recently released, represents a significant step towards the improvement of this situation. Aims: To prepare NGSL for population synthesis, we determined the atmospheric parameters of its stars, we assessed the precision of the wavelength calibration and characterised its intrinsic resolution. We also measured the Galactic extinction for each of the NGSL stars. Methods: For our analyses we used ULySS, a full spectrum fitting package, fitting the NGSL spectra against the MILES interpolator. Results: We find that the wavelength calibration is precise up to 0.1 px, after correcting a systematic effect in the optical range. The spectral resolution varies from 3 {\AA} in the UV to 10 {\AA} in the near-infrared (NIR), corresponding to a roughly constant reciprocal resolution R = {$\lambda$}/{$\delta\lambda$} {$\approx$} 1000 and an instrumental velocity dispersion {$\sigma$}ins {$\approx$} 130 km s-1. We derived the atmospheric parameters homogeneously. The precision for the FGK stars is 42 K, 0.24 and 0.09 dex for Teff, log g and [Fe/H], respectively. The corresponding mean errors are 29 K, 0.50 and 0.48 dex for the M stars, and for the OBA stars they are 4.5 percent, 0.44 and 0.18 dex. The comparison with the literature shows that our results are not biased.

Our analysis relies on deep Very Large Telescope/X-Shooter long-slit spectra, along with newly developed stellar population models, allowing for [Na/Fe] variations, up to {$\sim$}1.2 dex, over a wide range of age, total metallicity, and initial mass function (IMF) slope. The new models show that the response of the Na-dependent spectral indices to [Na/Fe] is stronger when the IMF is bottom heavier. For the first time, we are able to match all four Na features in the central regions of massive early-type galaxies finding an overabundance of [Na/Fe] in the range 0.5-0.7 dex and a bottom-heavy IMF. Therefore, individual abundance variations cannot be fully responsible for the trends of gravity-sensitive indices, strengthening the case towards a non-universal IMF. Given current limitations of theoretical atmosphere models, our [Na/Fe] estimates should be taken as upper limits. For XSG1, where line strengths are measured out to {$\sim$}0.8 Re, the radial trend of [Na/Fe] is similar to [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [C/Fe], being constant out to {$\sim$}0.5 Re, and decreasing by {$\sim$}0.2-0.3 dex at {$\sim$}0.8 Re, without any clear correlation with local metallicity. Such a result seems to be in contrast to the predicted increase of Na nucleosynthetic yields from asymptotic giant branch stars and Type II supernovae. For XSG1, the Na-inferred IMF radial profile is consistent, within the errors, with that derived from TiO features and the Wing-Ford band presented in a recent paper.},

  abstract = {We present a new evolutionary stellar population synthesis model, which predicts spectral energy distributions for single-age single-metallicity stellar populations (SSPs) at resolution 1.5 {\AA} (FWHM) in the spectral region of the near-infrared CaII triplet feature. The main ingredient of the model is a new extensive empirical stellar spectral library that has been recently presented by Cenarro et al., which is composed of more than 600 stars with an unprecedented coverage of the stellar atmospheric parameters. Two main products of interest for stellar population analysis are presented. The first is a spectral library for SSPs with metallicities -1.7 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$<$} +0.2, a large range of ages (0.1-18 Gyr) and initial mass function (IMF) types. They are well suited to modelling galaxy data, since the SSP spectra, with flux-calibrated response curves, can be smoothed to the resolution of the observational data, taking into account the internal velocity dispersion of the galaxy, allowing the user to analyse the observed spectrum in its own system. We also produce integrated absorption-line indices (namely CaT*, CaT and PaT) for the same SSPs in the form of equivalent widths. We find the following behaviour for the CaII triplet feature in old-aged SSPs: (i) the strength of the CaT* index does not change much with time for all metallicities for ages larger than {\textasciitilde}3 Gyr; (ii) this index shows a strong dependence on metallicity for values below [M/H]{\textasciitilde}-0.5 and (iii) for larger metallicities this feature does not show a significant dependence either on age or on the metallicity, being more sensitive to changes in the slope of power-like IMF shapes. The SSP spectra have been calibrated with measurements for globular clusters by Armandroff \& Zinn, which are well reproduced, probing the validity of using the integrated CaII triplet feature for determining the metallicities of these systems. Fitting the models to two early-type galaxies of different luminosities (NGC 4478 and 4365), we find that the CaII triplet measurements cannot be fitted unless a very dwarf-dominated IMF is imposed, or if the Ca abundance is even lower than the Fe abundance. More details can be found in work by Cenarro et al.},

These SEDs constitute our base models, as they combine scaled-solar isochrones with an empirical stellar spectral library [Medium resolution INT Library of Empirical Spectra (MILES)], which follows the chemical evolution pattern of the solar neighbourhood. The models rely as much as possible on empirical ingredients, not just on the stellar spectra, but also on extensive photometric libraries, which are used to determine the transformations from the theoretical parameters of the isochrones to observational quantities. The unprecedented stellar parameter coverage of the MILES stellar library allowed us to safely extend our optical SSP SED predictions from intermediate- to very-old-age regimes and the metallicity coverage of the SSPs from super-solar to [M/H]=-2.3. SSPs with such low metallicities are particularly useful for globular cluster studies. We have computed SSP SEDs for a suite of initial mass function shapes and slopes. We provide a quantitative analysis of the dependence of the synthesized SSP SEDs on the (in)complete coverage of the stellar parameter space in the input library that not only shows that our models are of higher quality than those of other works, but also in which range of SSP parameters our models are reliable. The SSP SEDs are a useful tool to perform the analysis of stellar populations in a very flexible manner. Observed spectra can be studied by means of full spectrum fitting or by using line indices. For the latter, we propose a new line index system to avoid the intrinsic uncertainties associated with the popular Lick/IDS system and provide more appropriate, uniform, spectral resolution. Apart from constant resolution as a function of wavelength, the system is also based on flux-calibrated spectra. Data can be analysed at three different resolutions: 5, 8.4 and 14 {\AA} (FWHM), which are appropriate for studying globular cluster, low- and intermediate-mass galaxies, and massive galaxies, respectively. Furthermore, we provide polynomials to transform current Lick/IDS line index measurements to the new system. We provide line index tables in the new system for various popular samples of Galactic globular clusters and galaxies. We apply the models to various stellar clusters and galaxies with high-quality spectra, for which independent studies are available, obtaining excellent results. Finally, we designed a web page from which not only these models and stellar libraries can be downloaded but which also provides a suite of on-line tools to facilitate the handling and transformation of the spectra.},

We compute models for a suite of initial mass function (IMF) shapes and slopes, covering a wide age/metallicity range. Using BaSTI, we also compute `base models' matching the Galactic abundance pattern. We confirm that the {$\alpha$}-enhanced models show a flux excess with respect to the scaled-solar models blueward {$\sim$}4500 {\AA}, which increases with age and metallicity. We also confirm that both [MgFe] and [MgFe]' indices are [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-insensitive. We show that the sensitivity of the higher order Balmer lines to [{$\alpha$}/Fe] resides in their pseudo-continua, with narrower index definitions yielding lower sensitivity. We confirm that the {$\alpha$}-enhanced models yield bluer (redder) colours in the blue (red) spectral range. To match optical colours of massive galaxies, we require both {$\alpha$}-enhancement and a bottom-heavy IMF. The comparison of globular cluster line-strengths with our predictions match the [Mg/Fe] determinations from their individual stars. We obtain good fits to both full spectra and indices of galaxies with varying [{$\alpha$}/Fe]. Using thousands of SDSS galaxy spectra, we obtain a linear relation between a proxy for the abundance, [ZMg/ZFe]SS(BaSTI), using solely scaled-solar models and the [Mg/Fe] derived with models with varying abundance ([Mg/Fe] = 0.59[ZMg/ZFe]SS(BaSTI)).

These model spectra were joined with those we computed in the visible using MILES, and other empirical libraries for redder wavelengths. The models span the metallicity range -1.79{$\leq$} [M/H]{$\leq$} +0.26 and ages above 30 Myr, for a suite of initial mass function types with varying slopes. We focus on the behaviour of colours, spectra and line-strength indices in the UV range as a function of relevant stellar population parameters. Whereas some indices strengthen with increasing age and metallicity, as most metallicity indicators in the visible, other indices peak around 3 Gyr for metal-rich stellar populations, such as Mg at 2800 {\AA}. Our models provide reasonably good fits to the integrated colours and most line strengths of the stellar clusters of the Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud. Our full spectrum fits in the UV range for a representative set of early-type galaxies (ETGs) of varying mass yield age and metallicity estimates in very good agreement with those obtained in the optical range. The comparison of UV colours and line strengths of massive ETGs with our models reveals the presence of young stellar components, with ages in the range 0.1-0.5 Gyr and mass fractions 0.1-0.5 per cent, on the top of an old stellar population.},

Pymiles documentation
===================================

Welcome to the documentation for pymiles - an python interface to the MILES
stellar library and SSP models. [#f]_
This package aims to provide users an easy interface to generate single stellar
population (SSP) models, navigate the stellar library or generate a spectra given
an input star formation history (SFH), among other things.
We try to make this package compatible with previously existing tools, namely
`astropy <https://www.astropy.org/>`_ and `specutils <https://specutils.readthedocs.io>`_.

We recommend you get started with the pymiles :doc:`tutorials/index` to understand
the possibilities of the package. Then, navigate to the :doc:`installation` instructions
to start using the code. Lastly, during your development process the :doc:`reference/index`
may be the best resource.
